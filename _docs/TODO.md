- [ ] Right now it’s possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
- [ ] Modify ContentView so that books rated as 1 star are highlighted somehow, such as having their name shown in red.
- [ ] Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning Date.now to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
